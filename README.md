# VPS-LNbits
_Documentation how to setup LNbits on a VPS, connected to your Lightning Network Node_

## Pre-Amble

### Objective
Your [LNbits](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits-legend) instance installed on a cheap, but anonymous [Virtual Private Server (VPS)](https://www.webcentral.com.au/blog/what-does-vps-stand-for), connected to your own, non-custodial [Lightning-Network](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd) Node running on both Tor and Clearnet [(Hybrid-Mode)](https://github.com/blckbx/lnd-hybrid-mode).

### Challenge
We want payment options with ₿itcoin to be fast, reliable, non-custodial - but the service should ideally not be easily to be identifiable. LNBits provides a quick and simple setup today, for instance on your Raspiblitz oder Umbrel, however, if you want to build the setup from scratch on your own, you have to bypass a number of technical discovery and hurdles. 

### Proposed Solution
There are plenty of ways how to solve for this. This creates hesitance to implement, especially when you're not very technical. This guide is supposed to provide _one approach_, whils there remain many other ways to Rome. 

## Pre-Reads
This guide heavily relies on the intelligence and documentation of others 🙏, but putting those together to one picture creates the last 10% hurdle which is sometimes the highest. Have a careful read through the following articles, to get a deeper understanding on some of the lighter references we'll be using further below
- [Hybrid-Mode for LND](https://github.com/blckbx/lnd-hybrid-mode)
- [TURN YOUR SELF HOSTED LIGHTNING NETWORK NODE TO PUBLIC IN 10 MINUTES](https://www.mobycrypt.com/turn-your-self-hosted-lightning-network-node-to-public-in-10-minutes/)
- [OpenVPN for Docker](https://github.com/kylemanna/docker-openvpn)
- [How to configure Umbrel LNbits app without Tor](https://community.getumbrel.com/t/how-to-configure-umbrel-lnbits-app-without-tor/604)


## Pre-Requisites
- running `lnd-0.14.1-beta` or later. This can either be [Umbrel](https://getumbrel.com), [Raspiblitz](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz), [MyNode](https://mynodebtc.com/) or even a bare [RaspiBolt](https://raspibolt.org/)
- Technical curiosity and not too shy to use the command-line
- An SSH connection to your node, and to the VPS as well. On Windows, use something like [putty](https://www.putty.org/) and get [putty-gen](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/putty/windows/puttygen), too
- VPS Account at DigitalOcean or any alternative VPS Solution out there offering similar capabilities (it's critical they offer a public IP for you)

## Preperations
It's generally advised to document your own steps. Make a bucket-list of things you've done, and a ToDo to go through in case your environment changes. Imagine yourself 18 months from now, you want to setup this new hardware-node: Will you remember all the steps or extra corners you've taken?
