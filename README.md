# VPS-LNbits
_Documentation to setup LNbits on a VPS, connected to your Lightning Network Node through a secured tunnel_
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0b/Brenner_Base_Tunnel_Aicha-Mauls.jpg/640px-Brenner_Base_Tunnel_Aicha-Mauls.jpg" alt="Brennerbasistunnel ‚Äì Wikipedia"/>

This is the first of two guides I've put together to get LNBits running on a VPS, connected to your node. This one below is using OpenVPN, the alternative [is linked here](https://github.com/TrezorHannes/vps-lnbits-wg) to achieve the similar, but with Wireguard. Have a read through both and see what your preference is. Personally, I have Wireguard running, since it's less overhead and further additions to the Port-Forwarding rules is easier.

Objective you came here, can be manyfold. You may
- have a dynamic IP from your Internet Service Provider
- want to hide your home IP from the world, for whatever reason
- desire to decrease your Lightning Node HTLC Routing times, so instead of running Tor only, you want Clearnet availability, too
- want others to leverage the LN Services you want to offer, via LNBits, BTCPay or others
- get a domain-name or use a free-domain host such as [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/) to point to your LNBits instance
- are just curious and want to tinker around a bit, because it's good to have those skills when demand for experience continues to rise

## Pre-Amble

### Objective
Your [LNbits](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits-legend) instance installed on a cheap, but anonymous [Virtual Private Server (VPS)](https://www.webcentral.com.au/blog/what-does-vps-stand-for), connected to your own, non-custodial [Lightning-Network](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd) Node running on both Tor and Clearnet [(Hybrid-Mode)](https://github.com/blckbx/lnd-hybrid-mode).

### Challenge
We want payment options with ‚Çøitcoin to be fast, reliable, non-custodial - but the service should ideally not be easily to be identifiable. LNBits provides a quick and simple setup today, for instance on your Raspiblitz oder Umbrel, however, if you want to build the setup from scratch on your own, you have to bypass a number of technical discovery and hurdles. 

### Proposed Solution
There are plenty of ways how to solve for this. This creates hesitance to implement, especially when you're not very technical. This guide is supposed to provide _one approach_, whilst there remain many other ways to Rome. 
Take your time following this through. It might take you 1-2hrs, depending highly on your skill. So don't go in here in a rush.


## Pre-Reads
This guide heavily relies on the intelligence and documentation of others üôè, but putting those together to one picture creates the last 10% hurdle which is sometimes the highest. Have a careful read through the following articles, to get a deeper understanding on some of the lighter references we'll be using further below
- [Hybrid-Mode for LND](https://github.com/blckbx/lnd-hybrid-mode)
- [TURN YOUR SELF HOSTED LIGHTNING NETWORK NODE TO PUBLIC IN 10 MINUTES](https://www.mobycrypt.com/turn-your-self-hosted-lightning-network-node-to-public-in-10-minutes/)
- [OpenVPN for Docker](https://github.com/kylemanna/docker-openvpn)
- [How to configure Umbrel LNbits app without Tor](https://community.getumbrel.com/t/how-to-configure-umbrel-lnbits-app-without-tor/604)
- [VPS LNBits with Wireguard](https://github.com/TrezorHannes/vps-lnbits-wg)


## Pre-Requisites
- running `lnd-0.14.2-beta` or later. This can either be [Umbrel](https://getumbrel.com), [Raspiblitz](https://github.com/rootzoll/raspiblitz), [MyNode](https://mynodebtc.com/) or even a bare [RaspiBolt](https://raspibolt.org/)
- Technical curiosity and not too shy to use the command-line
- A domain name or a subdomain registered at [DuckDNS](duckdns.org)
- An SSH connection to your node, and to the VPS as well. On Windows, use something like [putty](https://www.putty.org/) and get [putty-gen](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/putty/windows/puttygen), too
- VPS Account at DigitalOcean or any alternative VPS Solution out there offering similar capabilities (it's critical they offer a public IP for you)

_Disclaimer: this is a ref link, gets you $100 in credit over 60 days, while the cheapest option we use here comes at a cost of $5/month._


## Preperations
The better we prepare, the more we can deal with blindspots and the unexpected.

### Make notes
It's generally advised to document your own steps. Make a bucket-list of things you've done, and a ToDo to go through in case your environment changes. Imagine yourself 18 months from now, you want to setup this new hardware-node: Will you remember all the steps or extra corners you've taken?
Suggested Laundry-List, you can tick them off while you go through this guide
- [ ] IP-Adresses of VPS external, VPS Tunnel, Node Tunnel
- [ ] Ports which needs forwarding
- [ ] ToDos
- [ ] Questions / open items

### Visualize
Some of us are visual people. Draw your diagram to get an idea how you want things to flow
![Hight-lvl-Flowchart](https://github.com/TrezorHannes/vps-lnbits/blob/main/VPN_LNBits.png?raw=true)

### Secure
It goes without saying, but this guide doesn't go into the necessary security steps in detail, and can't take on liability for any things breaking or losing funds. Ensure you don't get reckless, start with small funds you're ok to lose. Keep an eye on developments or in touch with the active Telegram Groups, to get news and updates with low delays. Also, would recommend to do those steps with a peer, so you follow a second pair of eye review. Lastly, 2fa / yubikeys are your friends!


## Let's get started (LFG!)
Well, let's get into it, shall we?!

### Lightning Node
We will consider you have your **Lightning Node up and running**, connected via Tor and some funds on it. You also have SSH access to it and administrative privilidges

### VPS: Setup 
In case you don't have a **VPS provider** already, sign-up with [my referal](https://m.do.co/c/5742b053ef6d) or [pick another](https://www.vpsbenchmarks.com/best_vps/2022) which provides you with a static IP and cheap costs. Maybe you even prefer one payable with Lightning ‚ö°. In case you go for DigitalOcean, here are the steps to create a Droplet, shouldn't take longer than a few minutes:
   - [ ] add a new Droplet on the left hand navigation
   - [ ] chose an OS of your preference, I have Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS) x64
   - [ ] take the Basic Plan with a shared CPU, that's enough power. You can upgrade anytime if necessary
   - [ ] Switch the CPU option to "Regular Intel with SSD", which should get you down to $5/month
   - [ ] You don't need an extra volume, but pick a datacenter region of your liking
   - [ ] Authentication: Chose the SSH keys option and follow the next steps to add your public keys in here for secure access. For Windows, with putty and putty-gen referenced above, you should be relatively quick to use those keys instead of a password. [For Linux users](https://serverpilot.io/docs/how-to-use-ssh-public-key-authentication/), you probably know your ways already.
   - [ ] Add backups (costs), Monitoring or IPv6 if you wish to, however this guide won't use any of those items
   - [ ] Lastly, chose a tacky hostname, something which resonates with you, eg myLNBits-VPS

After a few magic cloud things happening, you have your Droplet initiated and it provides you with a public IPv4 Adress. Add it to your notes! In this guide, I'll refer to it as `VPS Public IP: 207.154.241.101`


### VPS: Connect to your VPS and tighten it up
Connect to your VPS via `SSH root@207.154.241.101` and you will be welcomed on your new, remote server. Next steps are critical to do right away, harden your setup:
   - [ ] Update your packages: `apt-get update` and `apt-get upgrade`
   - [ ] Install Docker: `apt-get install docker.io tmux`
   - [ ] Enable Docker automated start: `systemctl start docker.service`
   - [ ] Enable Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW) and add ports to be allowed to connected to: 
```
$ apt install ufw
$ ufw default deny incoming
$ ufw default allow outgoing
$ ufw allow OpenSSH
$ ufw allow 80 comment 'Standard Webserver'
$ ufw allow 443 comment 'SSL Webserver'
$ ufw allow 9735 comment 'LND Main Node 1'
$ ufw enable
```
   - [ ] Follow [further hardening steps](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-18-04), especially step 2) and 3) in the link, to set up non-root users for additional security enhancements. We consider in this guide you have added a user "admin" with sudo rights from this step forward.
   - [ ] Install fail2ban to protect your SSH user, it runs automatically on it's own `sudo apt install fail2ban`

### VPS: Install OpenVPN Server
Now we will get OpenVPN installed, but using a Docker Setup like [Krypto4narchista](https://twitter.com/_pthomann) suggests [here](https://www.mobycrypt.com/turn-your-self-hosted-lightning-network-node-to-public-in-10-minutes/). It's easier to setup, but needs some tinkering with port forwarding, which we will go into in a bit.
   - [ ] `export OVPN_DATA="ovpn-data"` which sets a global-name placeholder for your VPN to be used for all the following commands. You can make this permanent by adding this to survive any reboot via `nano .bashrc`, add it to the very bottom => CTRL-X => Yes. 
   - [ ] `sudo docker volume create --name $OVPN_DATA` notice how the $ indicates picking up the placeholder you have defined above
   - [ ] `sudo docker run -v $OVPN_DATA:/etc/openvpn --rm kylemanna/openvpn ovpn_genconfig -u udp://207.154.241.101`, whereby you need to adjust the 207.154.241.101 with your own **VPS Public IP**.
   - [ ] `sudo docker run -v $OVPN_DATA:/etc/openvpn --rm -it kylemanna/openvpn ovpn_initpki` this generates the necessary VPN certificate password. Take your password manager and create a secure pwd, which you will store safely. It will be needed once we create client-configuration files for your node to connect later.
   - [ ] `sudo docker run -v $OVPN_DATA:/etc/openvpn -d -p 1194:1194/udp -p 9735:9735 -p 8080:8080 --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --restart=unless-stopped kylemanna/openvpn` this works under two assumptions. If any of those aren't true, you need to adjust your settings, either on your node, or by starting the docker container with different ports: 
     1) your current LND Node configuration is listening on port 9735, which you can verify by looking into your `cat ~/.lnd/lnd.conf` => `[Application Options]` => `listen=0.0.0.0:9735`
     2) your LND RestLNDWallet is listening on port 8080, same location under `[Application Options]` => `restlisten=0.0.0.0:8080`

Your OpenVPN Server is now running, which means the Internet can now connect to your VPS via ports 80, 443, 9735 (and 22 SSH), and it has a closed tunnel established on port 1194. You need to complement your notes with the IP-Adresses which are essentially added with the running server.

   - [ ] CONTAINER-ID: `sudo docker ps` to list your docker container. In the first column, you will find the `CONTAINER-ID`, usually a cryptic 12-digit number/character combination. Copy into the clipboard and make a note of it. 
   - [ ] Docker Shell: Get into the container, with `sudo docker exec -it <CONTAINER-ID> sh`. 
   - [ ] VPS Docker IP: Run `ifconfig` and you typically find 3 devices listed with IPs assigned. Make a note of the one with eth0, which is your own `VPS Docker IP: 172.17.0.2`. Type `exit` to get out of the docker-shell.

### VPS: Install LNBits
Next we will install [LNBits](https://lnbits.com/) on this server, since it'll allow to keep your node independent and light-weight. It also allows to change nodes swiftly in-case you need to move things. We won't install it via Docker (like Umbrel does), but do the implementation based slightly on their [Github Installation Guide](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits-legend/blob/main/docs/devs/installation.md). You can also follow their [own, excellent video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/WJRxJtYZAn4?t=49) here. Just don't use Ben's commands, since these are a little dated.

```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt-get install git -y
$ git clone https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits-legend
$ cd lnbits-legend/ 

# to ensure python 3.9 is installed, check with python3 --version, skip this block if installed 3.9 or newer
$ sudo apt install software-properties-common
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
$ sudo apt install python3.9 python3.9-distutils

$ curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
$ export PATH="/home/admin/.local/bin:$PATH" # or whatever is suggested in the poetry install notes printed to terminal. this is important!
$ poetry env use python3.9 # or reference 3.10 if you have a newer version installed
$ poetry install --only main
$ poetry run python build.py

$ mkdir data && cp .env.example .env
$ poetry run lnbits --port 5000
```
	
If you run into trouble, check out the [original troubleshooting hints](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits-legend/blob/main/docs/guide/installation.md#troubleshooting). 
Now when this is successfully starting, you can abort with CTRL-C. We will come back to this for further configuration editing LNBits' config-file to our desired setup.


### VPS: Retrieve the OpenVPN config & certificate
In this section we'll switch our work from setting up the server towards getting your LND node ready to connect to the tunnel. For this, we will retrieve and transfer the configuration file from your VPS to your node.
   - [ ] `sudo docker run -v $OVPN_DATA:/etc/openvpn --rm -it kylemanna/openvpn easyrsa build-client-full NODE-NAME nopass` whereby `NODE-NAME` should be changed to a unique identifier you chose. For example, if your LND Node is called "BringMeSomeSats", I suggest to use that - with all lowercase.
   - [ ] `sudo docker run -v $OVPN_DATA:/etc/openvpn --rm kylemanna/openvpn ovpn_getclient NODE-NAME > NODE-NAME.ovpn` which will prompt you to provide the secure password you have generated earlier. Afterwards, it'll store `bringmesomesats.ovpn` in the directory you currently are.


## Into the Tunnel
We have installed the tunnel through the mountain, but need to get our LND Node to use it.

### LND Node: Install and test the VPN Tunnel
Now switch to another terminal window, and SSH into your **Lightning Node**. We want to connect to the VPS and retrieve the VPN-Config file, to be able to establish the tunnel
```
$ cd ~
$ mkdir VPNcert
$ scp admin@207.154.241.101:/home/admin/bringmesomesats.ovpn /home/admin/VPNcert/
$ chmod 600 /home/user/VPNcert/bringmesomesats.ovpn
```
_Note: You need to adjust `user`, the **VPS Public IP** and the absolute directory where the ovpn file is stored.

Now we need to install OpenVPN, start it up to see if it works.

**Important Warning**: Depending on your network-setup, there is a slight chance your LND Node Service gets interrupted. Be aware there might be small down-times of your lightning node, as we will reconfigure things. Be patient!

```
$ sudo apt install openvpn
$ sudo cp -p /home/user/VPNcert/bringmesomesats.ovpn /etc/openvpn/CERT.conf
$ sudo systemctl enable openvpn@CERT
$ sudo systemctl start openvpn@CERT
$ sudo systemctl status openvpn@CERT
```
You should see something similiar to the following output. Note this one line indicating the next important IP Adress `VPN Client IP: 192.168.255.6`. Make a note of it, we need it for port-configuration at the server, soon.

```
The tunnel between your LND Node and your VPS VPN is established. If you need to troubleshoot, call the systemctl journal via 
`sudo journalctl -u openvpn@CERT -f --since "1 hour ago"`


### VPS: Add routing tables configuration into your droplet docker
Back to your terminal window connected to your VPS. We have the `VPN Client IP: 192.168.255.6` now, which we need to tell our VPS where it should route those packets to. To achieve that, we'll get back into the docker container and add IPTables rules.

   - [ ] [Remember](#4-vps-install-openvpn-server) how to get into the container? Arrow-up on your keyboard, or do `sudo docker ps` and `sudo docker exec -it <CONTAINER-ID> sh`
   - [ ] Doublecheck your VPN Client IP, and adjust it in the following IPtables commands you enter into the container and confirm with Enter

```
$ iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 9735 -j DNAT --to 192.168.255.6:9735
$ iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 8080 -j DNAT --to 192.168.255.6:8080
$ iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -d 192.168.255.0/24 -o tun0 -j MASQUERADE
$ exit
```
What we basically do here, is assign a ruleset to say: As soon a packet arrives at device `eth0` on `port 9735/tcp`, forward it to the `VPN client` at `192.168.255.6:9735`, and vice versa everything at device `tun0`. If you have different ports or IPs, please make adjustments accordingly. What you also see, is a port `8080` preperation for LNBits packets, we'll get to this later.

#### Permanent saving of IPtable rules
Your VPS needs operational maintenance, and a reboot sometimes isn't avoidable. If you want to make the above iptable entries permanent, follow these steps:

   - [Follow this step again](#4-vps-install-openvpn-server) to get into the container,  arrow-up on your keyboard, or do `sudo docker ps` and `sudo docker exec -it <CONTAINER-ID> sh`
   - within the container, change the directory `cd /etc/openvpn` and open the environment-settings file for OpenVPN via `vi ovpn_env.sh`. Nano isn't installed in the docker container,  follow the [vi-cheatsheet PDF](https://www.atmos.albany.edu/daes/atmclasses/atm350/vi_cheat_sheet.pdf) if you get confused (and you will). Add the following lines to the file

```
$ iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 9735 -j DNAT --to 192.168.255.6:9735
$ iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 8080 -j DNAT --to 192.168.255.6:8080
$ iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -d 192.168.255.0/24 -o tun0 -j MASQUERADE
```
save with `:wq` and now your VPS adheres to those rules after a reboot, too. `exit` to get out of the container.
If you want to ensure the docker-container autostarts after a VPS reboot, add the restart option to docker via `sudo docker update --restart unless-stopped <CONTAINER-ID>`

### LND Node: LND adjustments to listen and channel via VPS VPN Tunnel
We switch Terminal windows again, going back to your LND Node. A quick disclaimer again, since we are fortunate enough to have plenty of good LND node solutions out there, we cannot cater for every configuration out there. Feel free to leave comments or log issues if you get stuck for your node, we'll be looking at the two most different setups here. But this should work very similar on _MyNode_, _Raspibolt_ or _Citadel_.

Be very cautious with your `lnd.conf`. Make a backup before with `cp /mnt/hdd/lnd/lnd.conf /mnt/hdd/lnd/lnd.bak` so you can revert back when things don't work out. 
The brackets below indicate the section where each line needs to be added to. Don't place anything anywhere else, as it will cause your LND constrain from starting properly.

_Adjust ports and IPs accordingly!_

## Connect VPS LNBits to your LND Node
The traffic line between the two connection points is established. Worth noting that this can be extended: In case you run more than one node, just repeat the steps above for additional clients. Now, let's get LNBits talk to your node.


### LND Node: provide your VPS LNBits instance read / write access to your LND Wallet
Assuming LND restarted well on your LND Node, your LND is now listening and connectable via VPS Clearnet IP and Tor. That's quite an achievement already. But we want to setup LNBits as well, right? So go grab another beverage, now we'll get LNBits running.
For that, let's climb another tricky obstacle; to respect the excellent security feats the LND engineering team has implemented. Since we don't want to rely on a custodial wallet provider, which would be super easy to add into LNBits, we have some more tinkering to do. Follow along to basically provide two things to your VPS from your LND Node. 

**Note of warning again**: Both of those files are highly sensitive. Don't show them to anyone, don't transfer them via Email, just follow the secure channel below and you should be fine, as long you keep the security barriers installed in [Section "Secure"](#secure) intact.

1) your tls.cert. Only with access to this file, your VPS is going to be allowed to leverage your LND Wallet via Rest-API
`scp ~/.lnd/tls.cert admin@207.154.241.101:/home/admin/` sends your LND Node tls.cert to your VPS, where we will use it in the next section.

2) your admin.macaroon. Only with that, your VPS can send and receive payments. See two options below. I've got several reports from umbrel users, that **option A** below doesn't work. If you encounter connection problems between LNBits and LND, try **option B** further below:
  a) copying over the macaroon as hex-string: `xxd -ps -u -c 600 ~/.lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/admin.macaroon` (Raspiblitz) or `xxd -ps -u -c 600 ~/umbrel/app-data/lightning/data/lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/admin.macaroon` (Umbrel 0.5x) will provide you with a long, hex-encoded string. Keep that terminal window open, since we need to copy that code and use it in our next step on the VPS.
  b) copying over your admin macaroon as file: `scp ~/.lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/admin.macaroon admin@207.154.241.101:/home/admin/`. Ensure to only allow your user to access it: `chmod 600 /home/admin/admin.macaroon`


### VPS: Customize and configure LNBits to connect to your LNDRestWallet
 Now since we're back in the VPS terminal, keep your LND Node Terminal open. We'll adjust the LNBits environment settings, and we'll distinguish between _necessary_ and _optional_ adjustments. First, send the following commands:
```
$ cd lnbits-legend
$ mkdir data
$ pwd
$ cp .env.example .env
$ sudo nano .env
```
Worth noting, that the directory `data` will hold all your database SQLite3 files. So in case you consider proper backup or migration procedures, this directory is the key to be kept.

#### Necessary adjustments
 | Variable | Description |
 | --- | --- |
 | `LNBITS_DATA_FOLDER="/home/admin/lnbits-legend/data"` | enter the absolute path to the data folder you created above | 
 | `LNBITS_BACKEND_WALLET_CLASS=LndRestWallet` | Specify that we want to use our LND Node Wallet Rest-API
 | `LND_REST_ENDPOINT="https://172.17.0.1:8080"` | Add your `VPS Docker IP: 172.17.0.1` on port 8080 | 
 | `LND_REST_CERT="/home/admin/tls.cert"` | Add the link to the tls.cert file copied over earlier | 
 | Option A: `LND_REST_MACAROON="HEXSTRING"` or Option B: `LND_REST_MACAROON="/home/admin/admin.macaroon"` | Copy the hex-encoded snippet from your LND Node Terminal output from Section 11.2 in here, or the absolute path to the file. Note, that the user running lnbits should have access to the file | 
 
 #### Optional adjustments
 | Variable | Description |
 | --- | --- |
 | `LNBITS_SITE_TITLE="HODLmeTight LNbits"` | Give your Website a tacky title |
 | `LNBITS_SITE_TAGLINE="free and open-source lightning wallet"` | Define the sub-title in the body |
 | `LNBITS_SITE_DESCRIPTION="Offering free and easy Lightning Bitcoin Payment options for Friends & Family"` | Outline your offering |
 | `LNBITS_THEME_OPTIONS="classic, bitcoin, flamingo, mint, autumn, monochrome, salvador"` | Provide different color themes, or keep it simple |
 
 `CTRL-X` => `Yes` => `Enter` to save

### VPS: Start LNBits and test the LND Node wallet connection
As soon you got here, we got the most complex things done üí™. The next few steps will be a walk in the park. Get another beverage, and then we will add LNBits to your [systemd service](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits-legend/blob/main/docs/guide/installation.md#lnbits-as-a-systemd-service) to automatically start / restart it after reboots.
Create a new config file with `sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/lnbits.service` and add the following content. Please adjust the lnbits working directory accordingly
```
# Systemd unit for lnbits
# /etc/systemd/system/lnbits.service

[Unit]
Description=LNbits

[Service]
# replace with the absolute path of your lnbits installation
WorkingDirectory=/home/admin/lnbits-legend
ExecStart=/home/admin/.local/bin/poetry run lnbits --port 5000
User=admin
Restart=always
TimeoutSec=120
RestartSec=30
Environment=PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Save and then enable it
```
sudo systemctl enable lnbits.service
sudo systemctl start lnbits.service
```

When this is successful, it'll report your wallet balance of your node, and you can move on. If not, a good debugging approach is to connect from the VPS to your node via `curl https://172.17.0.1:8080 -v --cacert /home/admin/tls.cert`. 


LNBits should now be running and listening on all incoming requests on port 5000. If you're impatient, you can `curl https://127.0.0.1:5000` and you should see a text-version of the LNBits UI. Note that because the way we run LNBits only locally, you can't test external access just yet. If `curl` doesn't provide meaningful response, check with the command `netstat -tulpen | grep 5000` to see if your process listening on port 5000.

If it looks all good, we'll go to the last, final endboss. 


### Your domain, Webserver and SSL setup 
(new version with caddy web server)

We don't want to share our IP-Adress for others to pay us, a domain name is a much better brand. And we want to keep it secure, so we need to get us an SSL certificate. Good for you, both options are available for free, just needs some further work.


#### Domain
While there are plenty of domain-name providers out there, we are going to use a free, easy and secure provider: [duckdns.org](https://www.duckdns.org/). They do their own elevator pitch why to use them on their site. Feel free to pick another, such as [Ahnames](https://ahnames.com/en), but this guide will use the former for simplicity
   - [ ] make an account on DuckDNS with GH or Email
   - [ ] add 1 of 5 free subdomains, eg. paymeinsats
   - [ ] point this domain to your `VPS Public IP: 207.154.241.101`
   - [ ] Make a note of your Token in case you chose nginx as webserver below

In this guide, you can chose either Caddy or Nginx as webserver install. The former is way simpler, but in case you're more familiar with Nginx, go for the latter:

#### üÜï VPS: Caddy web server
<details><summary>Click here to expand the web-server setup with Caddy as a web server</summary>
<p>


Caddy is an open source web server with automatic HTTPS certification and brings the web interface of your LNbits instance to the clearnet. It really takes care of everything very efficiently. You only have to point the DNS entry of the (sub)domain to the IP address of the VPS, and Caddy takes care of the rest.

##### First: Check DNS entry

Check beforehand whether the DNS entry also works and forwards the web domain directly to your VPS IP address. With [DNS Lookup](https://mxtoolbox.com/DNSLookup.aspx) or [whatsmydns.net](https://www.whatsmydns.net/).

##### Install Caddy
```
$ cd ~
$ sudo apt install -y debian-keyring debian-archive-keyring apt-transport-https
$ curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/gpg.key' | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/caddy-stable-archive-keyring.gpg
$ curl -1sLf 'https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/caddy/stable/debian.deb.txt' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/caddy-stable.list
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install caddy
```

##### Create the Caddyfile
```
$ sudo caddy stop
$ sudo nano /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
```

##### Fill the file with an adjusted domain address
```
paymeinsats.duckdns.org {
  handle /api/v1/payments/sse* {
    reverse_proxy 0.0.0.0:5000 {
      header_up X-Forwarded-Host paymeinsats.duckdns.org
      transport http {
         keepalive off
         compression off
      }
    }
  }
  reverse_proxy 0.0.0.0:5000 {
    header_up X-Forwarded-Host paymeinsats.duckdns.org
  }
}
```
`CTRL-X` => `Yes` => `Enter` to save

##### Add caddy autostart service
```
$ sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/caddy.service
```
##### Replace content with
```
# caddy.service

[Unit]

`CTRL-X` => `Yes` => `Enter` to save

##### Enable, start and check service
```
$ sudo systemctl enable caddy.service
$ sudo systemctl start caddy.service
$ sudo systemctl status caddy.service
```

</details>

#### VPS: nginx web server
<details><summary>Click here to expand if you prefer to use nginx web-server setup, which is more complex but also battle-tested</summary>
<p>
#### VPS: SSL certificate

You want your secure https:// site to confirm to your visitor's browser that you're legit. For this, we will use Certbot to manage our SSL certificate management.
```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install nginx certbot
$ sudo certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns
```
Next to a few other things, Certbot will ask you for your domain, so add your `paymeinsats.duckdns.org`. Then it'll prompt you to place a TXT record for \_acme-challenge.paymeinsats.duckdns.org, which is basically their way to verify whether you really own this domain. 
To achieve this, leave the certbot alone without touching anything, and follow those steps in parallel:
   - [ ] Open a text editor, and add this URL: `https://www.duckdns.org/update?domains={YOURVALUE}&token={YOURVALUE}&txt={YOURVALUE}[&verbose=true]`
   - [ ] replace each variable[^2]
     - `domains={YOURVALUE}` with your subdomain only, in our case `domains=paymeinsats`
     - `token={YOURVALUE}` with your token from your duckdns.org overview
     - `txt={YOURVALUE}` with the random text-snippet certbot provided you to fill in
     - optional: set `verbose=true` if you want 2 lines more info as a response
   - [ ] Copy that whole string into a new Webbrowser window, and if verbose isn't set as true, it'll be as crisp as `OK`
   - [ ] In a new Terminal window, install dig `sudo apt-get install dnsutils` to check if the world knows about you solved the challenge: `dig -t txt _acme-challenge.paymeinsats.duckdns.org`. Compare the TXT record entry with what Certbot provided you. If both are similar, confirm with `Enter` in the Certbot Terminal, so it can do it's own verification
   - [ ] Once successful, you got your SSL certificates. Make a note in your calendar when the validation time is over, so you renew early enough. Also take note of the absolute paths of those two certificates you received.

#### VPS: Webserver NGINX
Uvicorn is working fine, but we'll add a more robust solution, to be able to do some caching and better log-management: nginx (engine-x). We'll add a new configuration file for your website.

_Please don't forget to adjust domain names and paths below accordingly_

   - [ ] `sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/paymeinsats.conf` to create and edit your new configuration file nginx will use

Add the following entries
```
server {
        # Binds the TCP port 80
        listen 80;
        # Defines the domain or subdomain name
        server_name paymeinsats.duckdns.org;
        # Redirect the traffic to the corresponding 
        # HTTPS server block with status code 301
        return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
       }

server {
        listen 443 ssl; # tell nginx to listen on port 443 for SSL connections
        server_name paymeinsats.duckdns.org; # tell nginx the expected domain for requests

        access_log /var/log/nginx/paymeinsats-access.log; # Your first go-to for troubleshooting
        error_log /var/log/nginx/paymeinsats-error.log; # Same as above

        location / {
                proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5000; # This is your uvicorn LNbits local host IP and port
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
                proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_http_version 1.1; # headers to ensure replies are coming back and forth through your domain
       }

        ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/paymeinsats.duckdns.org/fullchain.pem; # Point to the fullchain.pem from Certbot 
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/paymeinsats.duckdns.org/privkey.pem; # Point to the private key from Certbot
}
```
`CTRL-X` => `Yes` => `Enter` to save
Next we'll test the configuration and enable it by creating a symlink from sites-available to sites-enabled.
```
$ sudo nginx -t

I'm also always grateful for incoming channels to my node: [HODLmeTight](https://amboss.space/node/037f66e84e38fc2787d578599dfe1fcb7b71f9de4fb1e453c5ab85c05f5ce8c2e3)


## Appendix & FAQ

#### I see anyone can create a wallet on my LNBits service, but I don't want that. How do I change that?
Once you have created your first user wallet, and you want only this to be accessible, go to the user-section in LNBits and notice the user-ID in the URL: `/usermanager/?usr=[32-digit-user-ID]`. Copy the user-id and add it to your `.env` file: `nano ~/lnbits-legend/.env` and add this to the variable `LNBITS_ALLOWED_USERS=""`. You can comma-seperate a list of user-ids.

#### I'm stuck and have no idea why it's not working. Who can help?
Please add an issue on Github with your question and provide as much detail as possible. Keep it safe though, no macaroon or user-ids!

#### So I have LNBits running, now what?
Head over to [LNBits Website](https://lnbits.com/) and check out the plethora of options you could do. For instance, I've built a donation wallet, which is shared 50:50 between the main author and my own wallet. All automated.

#### Why DigitalOcean - can't we pick a VPS where we can pay with Lightning, and anonymously
Consider this guide a work-in-progress. I've picked DigitalOcean since I know what I'm doing there. Heard good things about [Luna Node](https://www.lunanode.com/), it's cheaper and you can pay with sats, so will test this out next. Also happy to add further alternatives, leave comments if you think these can accomplish the same results. Fee free to provide suggestions here.

#### Can I add more nodes connecting to the tunnel? If so, how?
In fact, I have more than one node connected to the tunnel. You need to handle your port-forwarding appropriately, since every node needs their unique LND listen port. Eg Node 1 has 9735, Node 2 9736 and so on. Docker runs need to be called with further `-p for publish-options`, IPtable rules and UFW needs to be adjusted. But once you got this guide internalised, the principle should be clear. Otherwise, let me know.
